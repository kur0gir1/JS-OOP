# Employee Inheritance System

A JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming demonstration project showcasing inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation with a Bootstrap-based UI.

## Features

- **Class Hierarchy**: Implements an Employee class with Manager, Developer, and Programmer subclasses
- **OOP Inheritance**: Demonstrates method overriding across the class hierarchy
- **Bootstrap UI**: Responsive design with dark mode theme
- **Dynamic Employee Creation**: Add new employees of different types through a form
- **Search Functionality**: Find employees by name, job title, or address
- **Profile Pictures**: Customizable profile icons and background colors
- **Visual Styling**: Bootstrap Icons and custom CSS for enhanced UI

## Technical Implementations

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Base Employee class with inherited specialized subclasses
   - Polymorphism through method overriding
   - Encapsulation of employee properties

2. **Dynamic UI**
   - Interactive forms with validation
   - Real-time search filtering
   - Card-based UI for employee data display
   - Custom profile pictures with color and icon selection

3. **Modern JavaScript**
   - ES6 Classes
   - Event-driven programming
   - DOM manipulation

## Usage

1. View the list of existing employees
2. Add new employees through the form at the top
3. Change profile pictures by clicking the "Change" button under any profile
4. Search for specific employees using the search box

## Developer Notes

- The employee classes are defined in `app.js`
- UI styling is in `style.css`
- Profile picture functionality is in `profile.js`
- Main HTML structure and event handling in `index.html`
